 Once there was a rich merchant who had many ships
He bought and sold things from around the would.
 He lived in a big house by the sea.
He had three daughters. 
 the daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was the
most beautiful of all. In fact, she was so beautiful that
everyone called her "Beauty"
 Beauty was not only pretty but also kind and smart.

She loved reading. Her two sisters were not very nice though.
 They were selfish and greedy.
They liked to go to parties and to wear nice dresses.
Tjey were always mean to Beauty. They laughed at her when
she read books. They only thought about marring rich men.

 One day, there was a terrble storm at sea. All the merchant's
ships sank, so he lost everything. The man had to sell his big
house and move into a small house in the countryside.
 I'm sorry, my children. All my ships sank," said the man. We 
have to work to earn money."
 "But father," said the eldest daughter, "we have never worked in 
our lives. We don't know how to work."
 "We can't work. No rich man will want to marry us!" 
the middle daughter cried.

 The two sisters did not stop complaining. But Beauty did not complain at all.
Instead, she tried to be happy and to make everyone else happy.
 "I will clean the house, Father," she said. This house is small, but we can be happy
here."
Beauty worked hard every day. She woke up early in the morning and cleaned 
the house. She cooked breakfast, lunch, and dinner for her family. But her sisters
never did nay wprk. They sat around and complained all the time.

 One day, beauty's father received a letter. He read the letter and instantly cheered up.
 "Children, I just heard some good news," he said.
"One of my ships did not sink. It is bringing back lots of gold and silver for us. We are 
rich again. I must go to the port now."
 "Oh, Father, you must buy us some new dresses," said the two older sisters.
 "Yes, my dears, I will," said their father.

오후 9:46 2023-09-21

 Beauty did not want anything. She was happy just because she could see her father 
happy. "Please bring me a rose, Father." said Beauty. "There are no roses in our garden."
 Buauty's father hurried to the port. When he arrived there, he heard some bad news.
 "The gold and silver are gone." his friend told him.

 "Pirates stole it. There is your ship. It has many holes in it, so you must fix the hole
before the shop can sail again."
 Beauty's father fell to the ground.
 "Without any gold or silver, I cannot afford to fix my ship," said Beauty's father sadly. "I
will leave the ship there for now and return to the countryside."

 Then he remembered his daughters. He looked in his pockets and found only a few coins.
 "I don't have enough money to buy any dresses." Sadly, he started to walk back hone.
 Suddenly, the weather became terribly cold. It began to snow, and the wind blew heavily. 
Soon he was lost in a forest.
 "This is very strange," he said to himself. "I have never seen this forest before. I must be lost."

 He heard wolves howling loudly. He began to feel very afraid. "I must find some shelter. 
There is no way I will get home tonight." he said.
 He looked around and saw a light at some distance.
"What is that? Is there a house there?

오전 8:35 2023-09-25

 Beauty's father followed the light. After a few minutes, he found a castle.
"I wonder who lives here," he said. He went to the door of the castle.
 "Hello?" he called. But there was no answer. The door was open, so he walked inside.
 He saw no one. It was cold, and he was tired. 

오전 8:04 2023-09-26

 He entered a large hall. It was a dining room. A huge fire was burning in the fireplace.
And the dining table was full of food. There was a single plate on the table with a knife 
and fork beside it.
 "This must be someone's dinner," he thought. He waited for the person to arrive, but no 
one came.

Finally, after he had waited for a couple of hours, he sat down at the table and ate the food.
because he was starving, he ate all of the food. Then, he found a bedroom, and 
fell asleep immediately. 

오전 8:53 2023-09-28

 In the morning, Beauty's father woke up. He looked around the room. He saw some 
breakfast on the table. 
But he did not see anybody. He sat down at the table and enjoyed breakfast. While he ate
he looked outside.
He saw a beautiful garden full of flowers.

오전 9:07 2023-09-29

 
"That's strange," he thougth. "Last night, there was a huge snowstorm, but the sun is 
shining now, and the flowers are blooming."
 Just then, he remembered the promise that he had made to Beauty. "A rose!
he said aloud. "I promised Beauty I would bringher a rose."

오전 9:51 2023-09-30

He went out to the garden and found a rose bush. It was full of beautiful red roses.
 He picked one. But as soon as he picked the rose, he heard a loud roar. And he
saw a frightful, angry beast coming toward him.
 "You are dirty thief!" cried the Beast.
