 When I was in my thirties, I went to university and I took a business degree.
I spent thousands of hours of studying. I read thousands of books.
I read hundreds of thousands of articles and I come to some ideas about why some
people are more successful than others.

And i'm going to share those with you in the time that we have together.
So I have a question for you.
Who is the most important peoson in this room?
Exactly, you are the most important person in this room.
You are the most impotant person in your world.

And here you are the most important person in your own world and here's
what I discovered and it changed my life.
I discoved that how important you think you are determines almost everything
that happens to you.

If you think that you are an important person. You like yourself more.
if you like yourself more., you set bigger goals for youself.
iIf you like yourself more, you set higher standards for youself, you persist longer.
The more you like yourself, the more you like other people, the more you like 
other people, the more they like you and want to be in business with you.

The more important you feel you are the more valuable you feel you are, the
better is your health, and the better is your family.
Here's what we discovered.
Parents who like themselves raise children who like themselves.

오전 9:56 2023-09-30

Parents who like themselves raise children who have high levels of self-confidence.
They're all willing to take on every challenge to be successful.
The most wonderful thing you can do for your spouse and for your children is
to like youself and consider yourself to be a valuable person.
