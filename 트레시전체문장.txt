##  자신이 가장 소중한 존재

31	Now I've spoken in 25 countries. I've traveled in 90 countries.
32	I have learned different languages, not Korean.
33	But I've learned different languages so that I could understand their cultures.
34	When I was in my thirties, I went to university and I took a business degree.
35	I spent thousands of hours of studying, I read thousands of books.
36	I read hundreds of thousands of articles and I come to some ideas about why some people are more successful than others.

##  당신이 가장 중요하다

37	And I'm going to share those with you in the time that we have togheter.
38	So I have a question for you.
39	Who is the most important person in this room?
40	Exactly, you are the most important person in this room.
41	You are the most important person in your world.


##  자신을 얼마나 사랑하느냐가 성공의 열쇠

42	And here you are the most important person in your own world and here's what I discovered and it changed my life.
43	I discovered that how important you think you are determines almost everything that happens to you.
44	If you think that you are an important person. You like yourself more.
45	If you like yourself more, you set bigger goals for yourself.
46	If you like yourself more, you set higher standards for yourself, you persist longer.
47	The more you like yourself, the more you like other people, the more you like other people, the more they like you and want to be in business with you.
48	The more important you feel you are the more valuable you feel you are, the better is your health, and the better is your family.
49	Here's what we discovered.


##  자존감을 높여라

50	Parents who like themselves raise children who like themselves.
51	Parents who like themselves raise children who have high levels of self-confidence.
52	They're all willing to take on every challenge to be successful.
53	The most wonderful thing you can do for your spouse and for your children. Is to like yourself and consider yourself to be a valuable person.
54	So I want you to say these words for me. I want you to say these words. "I like myself"
55	From now on, whenever you think of any difficulty you simply say I like myself.
56	When I was young man, and I learned this my self-esteem was very low.
57	And your self-esteem is very much like a tire with a slow leak.
58	It starts to go flat whenever you go out to build your business or build your life.


##  자신을 사랑한다고 항상 외쳐라


59	So you have to keep pumping it up.
60	#"I like myself" "I like myself" "I like Myself" "I like Myself" "I like Myself"
61	Every time you say "I like myself" your self-esteem goes up.
62	Every time you have a difficulty or a problem, your self-esteem goes down.
63	When your self-esteem goes dwon, you pump it up, "I like myself" I like myself" "I like myself"
64	When I started off with this I would repeat this to myself 10 times, 20times, 50times a day.
65	I needed it, alright? You should do the same thing.
66	But I don't suggest that you say this in crowded elevators or in public wash rooms.
67	But just say "I like Myself" whenever you are going to a metting.


##  생각한대로 이루어진다

68	You get yourself psychologically ready by talking to yourself in a positive way.
69	Here's what we have learned.
70	95% of your emotions are determined by the way you talk to yourself.
71	If you talk to yourself in a positive way, you have positive emotions.
72	You have more self-confidence, you have high self-esteem.
73	People like you, People want to do business with you.


##  감정이 좌우한다

74	What percentages of your decisions are emotional?
75	And what percentages of your decisions are logical or rational?
76	Well the answer is 100% of your decisions are emotional.
77	Human beings are completely emotional.


##  네 인생의 발전

78	We decide with our emotions and then we justify it with logic.
79	If your want to build your business, remember this is how people feel about you.
80	Is the most important determination of what they do with you.
81	If they like you, and then like your personality then they want to be associated with you.
82	So when you go to work on yourself, you improve every part of your life.


##  자신을 사장이라고 가정하라


83	Final question, how many people here are self-employed?
84	Well, the true answer is that everyone is self-employed.
85	Everyone works for themselves. Everyone is the president of a company with one employee yourself.
86	You are the president of an entrepreneurial company with one service to sell and that's your services.


##  자신이 사장이다

87	Even if you work for someone else for all your life, you're always self-employed.
88	You are always the president of your own personal services corporation.
89	Now this is important because the top 3% of the people in our society see themselves as a self-employed.
90	Average people think that they work for someone else. but then that means they think that someone else controls their life.
91	That someone else makes decisions for them, that someone else would take care of them and love them and hold them.


##  모두 사장이 되어서 적극적으로 행동하라


92	Most people when they become adults go from their home with their mother and father to work and their boss becomes their mother and father.
93	And they want to be taken care of like little children.
94	But the fact is what when you become an adult, you become the president of your own life.
95	Now I have a magic pen here and I got this pen in Switzerland. and it's a magic pen that gives me special powers.


## 모두 사장임을 축하

96	And you shouldn't believe that.
97	But by the powers vested in me I hereby dub you all presidents.
98	You're all presidents, you're all CEOs, and you're all in charge of your own lives and your own companies. Congratulations!
99	If someone asks you where you worked tonight, you say you were at a president's conference.
100	Yes, you got together with other presidents from around Seoul to learn how to run your business more profitably in the coming year.
101	If they say "Well, I never heard about it"
102	You say "Well you probably weren't on the list"


## 능동적으로 행동

103	They say "What did they talk about it?"
104	You'll say "Well, mostly presidential matters"
105	They'll be of no interest they'll be of no interest to staffs.
106	In fact, if you're not with you're if you're not with your husband or wife tonight, afterwards you can phone home and say "I'm now the president of my own company"
107         You are the top 10%, you are pro-active, you make things happen, you don't wait for things to happen.
122	But let me tell you about myself just a minute.


##  나의 과거도 비참했었다

123	I started off from a poor family.
124	We did not have very much money.
125	My father and mother did not always have jobs.
126	From the time I was 10 years old, I worked in the neighborhood to earn my own money to pay for my own clothes, and I never took money from my parents again from the age of 10.
127	I did not graduate from high school.
128	I finished in the half of the class that makes the top half possible.


##  나의 과거에는

129	They say that everybody is good for something even if it's only to be a bad example.
130	And I was a bad example.
131	So when I left school, the only job that I could get was washing dishes in the back of small hotel.
132	And when i lost that job, I got a job washing cars with a car company and when I lost that job, I got a job washing floors with a janitorial service.
133	I thought that washing was going to be my future. But it was a downhill trail.
134	So when I lost those jobs, and lost when you say "I lost a job"
135	When you are young it means that you got fired, When I got fired from these jobs, I would go to the next job.


## 나는 노동자였다

136	I used to live in my car at one time because I didn't have a place to live.
137	I would work in factories sometimes in the afternoon sometimes overnight.
138	I worked in sawmill and lumber mill in the mountains.
139	I worked in construction labor.
140	I worked in construction labor.
141	I worked on a ship in the North Atlantic.
142	I did laboring jobs for many years.


## 성공하는 방법을 알아야 한다

143	How many people here are in sales?
144	OK, well, that's what I got into when I couldn't get laboring job as well.
145	SO I know where you're coming from.
146	SO I got into sales, and I didn't know how to sell.
147	They told me that "all you have to do is talk to enough people and you'll be successful"
148	Well, I wasn't afraid to work.


##  세일즈를 못함

149	So I went and began talking to people but nobody bought anything.
150	So I would talk to more people and still nobody bought anything.
151	So I began to run from place to place.
152	So I could be rejected more often.
153	And I did this for about six months going around in circles.
154	And every so often occasionally I would make a sale which is just enough to stay alive.
155	Then one day I did something ahs changed my life and it brought us here together.


##  Top세일즈 기법을 배우다

156	I went to the top sales man in my company.
157	He was selling 10 times as much as anybody else.
158	And I asked them "What are you doing differently from me?"
159	And he said, "Well, let me see if I can help you"
160	He said, "Show me your sales presentation"
161	I said, "What's a sales presentation?"


##  세일즈의 방법

162	He said, "Well, it's logical and orderly way of selling your product"
163	And I said "you mean there is a logical and orderly way of selling?"
164	And he said "Yes" and he showed me a logical and orderly way.
165	Which I'll explain to you a little bit later.
166	And so I began to sell in a logical way.
167	It's very much like phoning with the telephone.
168	If I ask you for your phone number and I say "I'll call you later"
169	And you'll give me a number.
170	Well I can take out my phone they provided this phones in the hotel.
171	I can take out my phone anyway and if I know your number, I can put in your number, And the phone will ring and you'll answer the phone.
172	If I give your number to someone else, they can phone you.
173	As long as you have the right phone number, you can get through to the person.
174	But what if I said to you I'll phone you later this week?
175	And you say "Yes." I say "goodbye" and you say "What? Don't you want my number?" I say "No, It's no problem. I'll find out your number by pushing the buttons."
176	And so I'll just push your number and say "Are you 00?"
177	No? I just push some more buttons.


##  성공의 기술을 배워라

178	How long will it take me to get through to a person?
179	If I just push the buttons randomly?
180	Probably my whole life probably never but if I have the right numbers in the right order, I could get through Immediately.
181	If you sell in the right order, if you do anything in the right proper sequence, you make far better results than if you just do it randomly.
182	So he showed me how to sell systematically.
183	So I began selling in a logical order and my sales went up.


##  세일즈기술을 배우다

184	And then I began reading books on selling. And my sales went up.
185	And I began listening to audio programs on selling and my sales went up.
186	And then I began to attend conferences like this.
187	And I still remember the first one that I attended I've never been to one before
188	And I said and took notes and then I practiced what I learned.
189	And my sales went up, and up, and up.
190	And soon I was the top sales man.


##  성공은 우연이 아니다

191	Soon the person who started me was working for me.
192	Within a year I was in charge of all the sales people.
193	Within two years I was in charge of six countries.
194	And I had 95 sales people.
195	And my whole life was transformed.
196	Now what I learned was this.


##  실패도 우연이 아니다

197	What I learned was the oldest law in human philosophy.
198	The local oldest law in human history which is the law of cause and effect.
199	The law of cause and effect says everything happens for a reason.
200	It says the success is not an accident.
201	Failure is not an accident. I learned later that my friend who was earning 10 times as much as anybody else had worked for a large company
202	Some years before the large company has been one year training him in professional selling.
203	As a result, he could go anywhere and any countires he could sell any products Because he had the formula, he had a recipe, he had a system.
204	And once he shares the recipe with me I could sell as much as I wanted, anywhere I went.


##  다른사람과 공유

205	Once I share it with another people, they can sell as much as they wanted.
206	Today when I travel around the world to countries that I've worked in before where I recruit sales people I meet them again
207	And they're millionaires, they're wealthy, they all own their own businesses.
208	They own property, they have large bank accounts.
209	These are people that I recruited new off the street.
210	Who had no money, had no jobs, and had no sales skills.
211	And I trained them in the method of selling.
212	And today they're wealthy all over he world they're rich.


##  상대가 낫다고 생각

213	I sat down with a gentle man who worked for me many years ago last year.
214	He is now worth about 25million dollars.
215	And when he came to work for me, he had only old clothes and no money.
216	He had not eaten for about 2 o 3 days.
217	This is what happens.
233	If somebody gets better grades than you, you think "well, this person is smarter than me" so therefore if this person is smarter then I must be dumber.
234	So therefore "what should I try? Becasuse he's smarter and I'm dumber."
235	Then we go to the enxt step.


##  그 누구도 나보다 낫지않다 다를뿐

236	We think "well, if he's smarter than me, it's probably better than me"
237	But if he's better than me, then I'm worse than his.
238	So then we think "well, he must be worth more than me"
239	So I must be worthless. And this is the big problem we have.
240	Is we are always looking at ourselves as being less than other people.
241	What changed my life was when I discovered that nobody is better than you and nobody is smarter than you.
242	People are just smarter in different ways.
243	People have different talents and abilities.


##  장학생은 car wash를 하고있다

244	When I was going to school there was a boy who got top grades in every class.
245	He got scholarship to the best university
246	And he never worked, he was very friendly and he never worked, he always got top grades.
247	If he got 99 % in any examination, he would be angry with himself because he always got 100%.
248	Today he sells used cars on a small car lot in a small town.
249	And that's when he's been doing for 20 years selling used cars.
250	Me? I dindn't even graduate from school and I'm doing better than he is.
251	Here's my point. Here's my point.
252	Nobody is better than you and nobody is smarter than you.


##  공부하는 스킬이 중요하다

253	He just had figured out he had learned how to study.
254	And studying is a skill.
255	You can actually take its course in study skills.
256	And if you take the course in study skills, you'll get straight "A" s from then on.
257	If nobody ever gave you a course in study skills then you may have gotten poor grades in schools.


##  핑계는 필요없다

258	And even today 20 or 30 years later, you'll still thinking "well, I'm not very smart"because I didn't get good grades in school.
259	And what that does it cause you to put your foot on your own brakes and hold yourself back.
260	You set it big goals. You set little goals instead of persisting you quit.
261	Instead of becoming really successful, you think of excuses and reasons why it's not possible.
262	Oh, I'm too young "Oh, I'm too old" "I didn't go to college or university" or "I didn't come from a rich home" or "I'm not handsome" or "I'm not beautiful" or something.
263	We always think of reasons to hold ourselves back.
264	I would like to tell you that there are no reasons.


##  어떻게 성공할 것인가

265	All of the reasons exist in your own mind.
266	They don't exist in reality.
267	Well so I've traveled and I began to learn this law of cause and effect.
268	I would apply it in every business I ever went into.
269	The first question I asked is "how do you succeed in this business?:


##  성공의 비결을 묻다

270	And I would go to the top people in the business and I would say ask for their advice.
271	#"How do you succeed in this business?: and they told me and I did it and I achieved success.
272	I would go to the library and I would check out all the books on real estate, importation and distribution, management, sales, sales amnagement, business building, entrepreneurial ship.
273	I would check out all the books and I would read and read and rad and read.
274	And tehn I would go and practice.
275	And I said asked before "who is the most important person in this room?"
276	And you're right. You are the most important person.


##  행동으로 옮기는게 중요하다


277	What is the most important part of this day of this time we spend together?
278	The answer is the action you take afterwards.
279	The most important part of what you learned is not the content of what you learned.
280	Its the action that you'll take.
281	All successful people are action-oriented.
282	They're constantly taking action on new ideas.
283	Now if you take action on a new idea, only two things can happen.


##  이유는 필요없디

284	What are they? Well, you can succeed or you can fail.
285	If you succeed, you do more of that.
286	If you fail, you learn and become smarter which makes it more likely you will succeed next time.
287	So you cannot lose by taking action
288	You can only lose by not acting at all.
289	And the majority of people don't take action.
290	The majority of people will ehar good ideas.
291	But then they'll always have an excuse for not taking action today.


##  빨리 행동을 취하라

292	Many years ago, I spoke with Rich Devos, founder Amway Corporation.
293	And we were talking about these subjects.
294	And he said to me, he said that we have determent in our business that there's a direct relationship between how quickly a person takes action on a new idea.
295	And how likely it is that they'll every be successful at any things.
296	What we found is that people who hear a new idea and take action within 24 hours will take action on other ideas as well.
297	But ever person hears a new idea and doesn't do anything with it for a few days.
298	The chances are nothing will ever happen.


##  행동이 열쇠다

299	He said action-orientation is the key.
300	The best studies have been done in the last 50 years looking at successful people whose lives are going better and better.
301	And unsuccessful people whose lives have flattened.
302	They find the successful people have one quality.
303	They're always taking action. They're always doing more things.
304	So if you hear something good tonight, be sure to take action on it and take action as fast as you can because that soon becomes a havit.
305	And when you develop the habit of action-orientation
306	You'll accomplish more in the next 2 or 3 years than the other person who accomplishes in 10 or 20 years.
307	Action-orientation transforms your life.


##  생각이 인생을 만든다

308	Well when I learned from this law of cause and effect was this.
309	Thoughts are cause and conditions the conditions of your life are the effects.
310	Your thinking creates your life
311	ANd this is the greatest thought in history.
312	So they interviewed more than 350,000 people like you.
328	And they were interviewing them every week for 6 weeks or 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months.
329	And once each week they would phone them often that would say "What are you thinking about right now?"
330	And the person would say what I'm thinking about this and they would write it down.


##  지금 무슨 생각을 하는가?

331	One week later then they would call and say "What are you thinking about right now?"
332	They would do this every week for many months.
333	And gradually they began to see a profile.
334	And they then took this group of people and they sliced them up into 10%, The bottom 10%, the next 10%, and finally the top 10%.
335	And you are in the top 10%.
336	So they looked at the way people in the top 10% think most of the time.
337	ANd can you guess with the top people the happiest highest paid most successful people think about most of the time?
338	Can you guess?
339	Well the answer is they think about what they want and how to get it most of the time.
340	Then you say "that's too simple?"


##  성공의 열쇠

341	No, it's the key to success.
342	It's successful people think about what they want and how to get it.
343	They think about their making more money and doubling their income
344	They think about health and they think about their family,
345	They think about their home, they think about their car,
346	They think about what they want most of the time and they think about how to get it.
347	And I want to share with you a word which you already know.
348	And this is the most important word for success. Are you ready?
349	It's the word "how"
350	So from now on, whenever you have a goal the only question you ask is "how"


##어떻게 이 문제를 풀지?

351	Whenever you have a problem, the only question you ask is "how do I solve it?"
352	When if you want to double your income, the only question you ask is "how do I double my income?"
353	So I want you to say the word, say "how"
354	Now say it again. "How" wonderful!
355	From now on, whenever there is anything in your life that you want to change, the only question you ask is "how"
356	Because "how" is the question of the top 10%.


##누군가 이미 성취한 문제

357	How is the question of the self-responsible person.
358	How is the question of the action-oriented person.
359	The person who asks "how" is one of the top people in our society.
360	Everyone works for and under the people who think in terms of "how"
361	Here's a good point.
362	Every goal that you could ever have has already been achieved by someone.
363	Every problem you could ever have has already been solved by someone.
364	Every question you could ever ask has already been answered by someone.


##  어떻게 ?

365	Your question is simply to ask "how"
366	How did others do it?
367	And there's rule in success that says "success leaves tracks"
368	In other words, there're tracks to any kind of success you want and your job is to find the tracks and follow the racks to double your income, to create a wonderful life.
369	All the answers have been found.
370	And nobody is better than you, nobody is smarter than you.


## 성공한 사람은 낙관적이다

371	If someone is doing better than you today. there's simple explanation.
372	They figured out "how" before you did. That's all.
373	And here's another discovery.
374	So we ask "what is the most important quality for success, happiness and long life?"
391	Can you guess what the most important quality is?
392	Well, the answer is very simple.
393	In interviewing tens of thousands of successful people they find the number one quality is the quality of "optimism"



##항상 좋은면을 보라


394	Successful people are opimists.
395	They're positive about themselves and their future.
396	They think about what they want most of the time and they are what we called realistic optimist.
397	That means they recognized that there are a lot of problems in the world
398	But they are realistic and they are optimistic about solving the problems and achieving their goals. so what we leared is this.


##  낙관적 연습

399	Is that optimism is the quality of mind.
400	And you can compare your mind with your body in this way.
401	As you can have physical fitness, just as you can have mental fitness.
402	Now if you want to be physically fit, you exercise physically
403	That is how you become physically fit and you must you might have to exercise for a long time.
404	If you want to become mentally fit which is if you want to become an optimist, you have to exercise mentally as well.


##  낙관주의자의 마인드

405	By the way before I tell you the keys to optimism to learning how to become an optimist,
412	Can you guess what unhappy, negative, unsuccessful people think about most of the time?
413	Well, the answer is they think the opposite way from optimists.
414	Optimists think about what they want, and how to get it.
415	Pessimists think about what they don't want, their problems, and who's to blame.
416	Optimists think about the future and where they're going.


##  과거를 생각지마라

417	Pessimists think about the past and who hurt them in the past.
418	Optimists let go over the past because they can't do anything about it.
419	Pessimists hold onto the past because it's all they have.
420	So your job is to let go of the past.
421	One of the greatest rules for success in life is don't spend any time worrying about something that you can't change.
422	So keep looking for something good.
439	Let me ask you a question.



## 뇌의 스위치를 재치있게 가동시켜라


440	Does anybody have in their home a dimmer switch that you turn up and down to increase the light lowering the light?
441	Does anybody have a dimmer switch at home? Okay, say "yes"
442	Everybody has a dimmer switch.
443	If you don't have a dimmer switch, you know what it is, alright?
444	So you notice they have a dimmer switch in this room.


##  규칙이 있다

445	They keep changing the lights up and down.
446	The person who is perating in this demon switch is smoking something.
447	So he's having a good time, he's turning to switch up and dwon.
448	Anyway, Here's the rule.
449	When you turn the dimmer switch up, it's bright.
450	When you turn it down, it's dark.
451	You have a dimmer switch on your brain as well.


##  dimmer 스위치

452	When you think about what you want and how to get it, your dimmer switch goes on full.
453	When your mental dimmer switch is fully lit, you're more creative, you're more positive,
454	you have more energy, you are more personable and friendly, you are more intelligent,
455	You are the best person you can possibly be when your dimmer switch is on full.
456	And whenever you think about what you want and how to get it, your demon switch goes on full.
457	Whenever you think or look for the good in a difficult situation, your demon switch goes on full.
458	Bye the way here's the rule.


##  dimmer 스위치를켜라

459	If you look for something good in a difficult situation, you'll always find it. You'll always find it.
460	You'll always find something good if you look for it.
461	And when you find it, your dimmer switches all go on full.
462	Here's the third key to becoming a complete optimist.
463	And it is to look for the valuable lesson in every difficulty or problem that you have.
464	Let me repeat.
465	Look for the valuable lesson in every problem or difficulty that you have.
466	And a couple of things will happen.
467	First, while you're looking for the lesson, your dimmer switch will go on full and you'll be positive, you'll be creative, you'll have high-energy.
468	If you're looking for who's to blame and who, what went wrong your demon switch goes right down to negative.
469	When your dimmer switch is down low you become angry, you become fearful, you become worried, you become impatient and so on.


##  신은 문제꺼리를 선물로주신다

470	So your job is to keep your dimmer switch on full most of the time.
471	Successful people are people who make a habit of thinking the thoughts that keep their dimmer switch on full
472	rather than allowing themselves to think thoughts that make them feel unhappy.
473	So, I had a friend. Once he told me that every time God wants to send you a gift.
474	He wraps it up in a problem.
475	And if God wants to send you a big gift what it means is a really valuable lesson.
476	He wraps it up in a big problem.


##  문제꺼리는 일생다반사

477	So I know that many of you fell you have too many gifts right now.
478	But if you look into every problem as a gift, you'll always find a gift.
479	And I want to give you an exercise.
480	First of all, question.
481	Does anybody here have any problems?
482	Of course, we all have problems.
483	It is normal and natural to have problems.


##  인생은 문제의 연속

484	All of life is a continuous series of problems.
485	The only interruption in this series of problems is the occasional crises.
486	So if you're living in normal life, you'll have a crisis every 2 or 3 months.
487	It will be problem, problem, problem, problem, problem, crisis, problem, problem, problem, problem, problem, problem, crisis
488	So your life will be series of problems and crises.
489	Which means by the way that everyone in this room is either in a crisis right now
490	or you just got out of the crises or you're just about to have a crisis.
491	And that's the way the world works.


##  어떻게 문제를 풀것인가

492	The only thing that matters is how you deal with the problems and crisis.
493	So I want you to think about your problems.
494	This is your biggest problem in your life.
502	Sometimes it's a financial problem.
503	Sometimes it's a relationship problem.
504	Sometimes it's a health problem.
505	But I want you to think about your biggest problem just for a moment.


##  모든문제는 교훈을 담고있다

506	And then I want you to imagine that this problem was designed just for you on the other side of the universe.
507	And it was designed by a great power in the universe.
508	That wants you to be successful and happy.
509	And this power knows that for you to be successful and happy.
510	You have to learn a series of lessons.
511	This power also knows that you will not learn a lesson unless it hurts you in some way,
512	unless you suffer emotional pain or financial pain or physical pain,
513	unless you suffer in some way you will not learn.
514	And every problem contains a lesson.


##  문제를 안고있는 사람을 격려하라

528	Now if you want to have tremendous positive influence on other people, here's a very simple way.
529	Especially your friends, your business associates, your down lines and your children, this help them be clear about what they want
530	And encourage them to think and talk about what they want most of the time.
531	When your friends or your family have problems, help them to look for the good in the problem and while you're both looking for good,
532	both of your dimmer switches would go on full.


##  이 문제의 교훈은 무엇인가?

533	And finally if you have a person in your life who has a problem, ask them this question.
534	What lesson are you meant to learn from this problem?
535	What lesson is contained in this problem that is just for you?
536	And my promist is you're always finding the lesson.
537	And the lesson will be the greater value than the cost of the problem.
538	Does anybody know what I am talking about so far?


##  성공하는 자의 마인드


539	This makes sense. Ok.
540	So this is the way the top people think most of the time.
541	This is the way the top people think.
542	Even if everything seems to be against them, they still believe that they're going to be successful.
552	And they never let go of that idea.



553	Imagine that your mind is like a computer
554	And as you know, a computer runs on the programs that are put into the computer.
555	So imagine that there was a computer store that sold beliefs because your mind runs on your beliefs.
556	If you have positive optimistic beliefs, that's how you run your life.
557	If you have negative or fearful beliefs, that's how your life runs.
558	So imagine there was a special computer store.




559	And you could go down and you could buy a special belief for yourself and program it to the back of your com... mental computer.
560	What would be the very best belief for you to have?
561	Well, I've thought about this for 25 years.
562	And my answer is the best belief for you to have is this.
563	Is that you're going to be really successful and really happy in your life.



564	If you have this belief, the belief is I am going to be really successful and really happy in my life.
565	If you have this belief, you will act in a way consistent with this belief.
566	You will do the things consistent with your belief.
567	ANd you will eventually have a happy and successful life.
568	So the most important belief you can have and it's the same belief that all top people have throughout history
569	Is that you are going to be a big success in life.
570	Thats your belief.




571	If you believe that you're going to be a gib success, it will trigger two special behaviors.
572	Special behavior No.1 is that you will try more things.
573	You will try more different things. You will talk to mroe people,
574	You will make more calls. You will read more books,
575	You will take more actions. You will set more goals, you will try more things.
576	In our society we believe a lot in luck.



577	When we see someone who is successful, we say that person is lucky.
578	And we do all kinds of things so we can be sure of having as much luck in our life as possible.
579	However when I wen to university in the 30's,
580	I took a course on the subject of what is called 'probabilities'.
581	And it's a very difficult course to take.
582	Is anybody taking in this course in school 'probability theory'?
583	It's a don't take the course. It's a terrible course




584	But you ahve to...what...what tehy teach you is a...
585	There's probability of everything happening.
586	There's a probability of you living to eighty-years-old.
587	There's a probability of you driving your car without an accident for a year.
588	There's a probability that lightning would strike somewhere.
589	There's a probability that you'll become rich in the course of your life time.
590	Now your job and my job are to increase the probabilities for the things we want to happen.
591	Here's the discovery.
592	If you try more things, and you try more different things, you increase the probability of success.



593	And when you're successful, it's not luck.
594	It's just that you try more things.
595	If you try more things, you increase the probability that you'll try the right thing at the right time with the right resources.
596	If you try only a few things, you lower the probability of success.
597	You and I can't control what is going to work and what is not going to work.
598	We can't control what would be successful and what would not be successful.
599	But we can control the number of different things that we try.
600	And if you control the number of things that you try, and you try more things,
601	By extension you'll guarantee your success.




602	Every successful person is an optimist, who tries lots of things,
603	Because he believes he is destine to be successful. or she believes she is destined to be successful. So try more things.
604	Now the second quilty of optimists is that they persist longer than other people.
605	As a matter of fact, optimists never quit.
606	Optimists continue to persist week after week, mmonth after month, year after year,
607	Optimists never give up. They just never quit.



608	It is the greatest of all rules for success is first of all try more things and second of all never give up.
609	And you can immediately respond and you don't quit.
623	When I learned this in my early 20's, it had an enormous impact on my life.
624	From then on I made a decision that when I set a goal, I'll never quit.
625	I will simply never quit.




626	And I don't have anymore intelligence or ability than you do.
627	But I do know one thing is I just never quit.
628	I mean you can shoot me "boom" dead but I won't quit.
629	I will just keep on going like. So...so that must be your decision as well.
630	You make a decision when you decided that you want something in your life.
631	You want to double your income.
632	That you're going to double your income and you will not quit.



633	You'll just keep on trying more things until you succeed. And if you make that decision,
634	Your success is guaranteed. YOur success is guaranteed.
635	Ok let me ask...Now I'm going to give you a quick test.
636	I'm going to ask you to write down your 3 most important goals in life right now.
637	Please take out your piece of paper, your pad.
638	And write down your 3 most important goals in life right now.
639	You have 30 seconds to write. You now have 20 seconds left.
640	Write quickly.




641	If you can't think of 3 goals, just write money, money, money.
642	You have 10 seconds left. 5 seconds, 4, 3, 2, 1 stop.
643	Now this is a special method of goal setting that you can use all your life.
644	We have just discovered that if you only have 30 seconds to write down your 3 most important goals,
645	Your answers will be as accurate as if you have 30 minutes or 3 hours.
646	When you are forced to write down your 3 most important goals,



647	Your true goals will emerge on the paper.
648	Now let me see if I can guess what your 3 goals were.
649	In 80 percent of cases, your 3 goals will be a financial goal, a health goal, and a realtionship o family goal, right?
650	And the reason for that is simple. Those are the 3 main areas of you life
651	Now I want to tell you something else.
652	If I were to ask you "what are your 3 biggest problems in life?"
653	Your 3 goals are the solutions to your 3 problems.




654	If you achieve the 3 goals, you'd solve your 3 biggest problems.
655	One last point is remember we said the successful poeple think about the future and wehre they're going.
656	And when you think like the top people, you will get the same results as the top people.
673	It's a law that says that your outer world will always be a mirror or every reflection of your inner world.



674	So therefore your outer world today is a reflection of what you're thinking about today most of the time.
675	If you change what you're thinking, if you reprogram, then your outer world will change.
676	So it's consistent with your inner program.
677	It's sort of like projecting on a screen.
678	Imagine that your eyes are projection lenses.




679	The screen is your reality or your world
680	And your thoughts are what are projected through your eyes under the screen.
681	You always project yourself under the screen of your life.
682	Wherever you look, you see yourself. Wherever you look,
683	There is yourself reflected back.



684	So how do top people think most of the time?
685	They have what we call 'orientations' now and 'orientation' is a general way of thinking.
686	And the first orientation is what we call 'future orientation'.
687	That means that top people think about the future most of the time.
688	Top people think about where they're going most of the time.
689	Now the greater clarity you have with regard to the answer to this question.


##  목표달성 날짜를 정하라


708	The faster you move toward it, the faster if moves toward you.
709	The greater clarity you have, the easier it is to make decisions.
710	The greater clarity you have of your future vision for your life,
711	The easier it is for you to learn lessons.
712	Now I flew here from Los Angeles yesterday morning. I left Lost Angeles,



713	And when the plane left and got into the air,
714	The pilot came over said "ladies and gentlement, we will be arriving in Seoul in 12 hours and 37 minutes"
715	12 hours and 37 minutes and then the plane started.
716	Now if you know anything about airplanes,
717	You know that airplane was off course 99 percent of the time.
718	99 percent of the time, the airplane was off course.
719	All airplanes are off course 99 percent of the time.




720	So the pilots are continually bringing the plane back on course.
721	They have winds that move the plane,
722	They have turbulence and clouds they go up and down.
723	So the plane is off course 99 percent of the time.
724	But can you guess when the plane arrived in Seoul?
725	How long the flight took? 12 hours and 37 minutes.
726	And the plane landed in the Seoul airport,
727	Exactly to the minute that they predicted in Los Angeles when the plane took off
728	even though it was off course most of the time.
729	When you have a clear vision for your future,


##  최상의 시간

730	And you know what your perfect future will look like,
731	You'll be off course most of the time.
732	You'll be making mistakes and you'll be trying more things,
733	And you'll be learning lessons, and you have temporary setbacks,
734	And you'll have difficulties, and you'll be learning from every experience,
735	And you'll be getting off course and on course and off course and on course.
736	And just at the right time, you'll achieve your goal.


##  목표를 명확히

737	You'll arrive at the airport of your goal exactly the way you thought,
738	As long as you're clear about your destination.
739	Imagine if I took off in a Korean airline plane.
740	And the pilot came on and said "thank you for flying with Korean air.
741	We don't know where we're going so we're going to fly around for a while and see if we find anything nice"
742	Do you know that airplanes do not coast?
752	Jets have to be moving at about two hundred and fifty kilometers and hour in all the land.
753	If they slow below 250 kilometers, they fall like a stone out of the air.


##  미래 지향으로 가라

754	And they go splat.
755	If every you take a flight, and they say.
756	Ladies and gentlemen, the life jackets are under the seat
757	In case of any emergency water landing
758	Proceed to the emergency exit door and put on you life jacket


##  
759	Blow it up 'BU-' like this
760	Have you seen those? It never happens.
761	And successful people will always give you advice.
779	They'll always tell you what to do.
780	And if you just do what other successful people do,
781	You'll soon get the same results that other successful people get.




782	By the way, ehre's a quick point.
783	Rich Divoce of Armway also told me this
784	He said "If you're not going to commit for 5 years to this business."
785	He said "don't get into it at all"
786	He said "it takes five years to master any new business."



787	And this is based on years of research.
788	If you decide to become a sales person, it'll take you 5 years to master it.
789	If you decide to become a lawyer, it'll take you 5 years after you graduate
790	Before you'll (become) begin to become successful.
791	If you decide to become a doctor, after all your training.
792	It'll still take 5 more years before you're successful.
793	So therefore, if you're not willing to commit 5 years,
794	Don't start at all.




795	Alright, well so developed future-orientation and think about the future most of the time.
796	If someone has a problem, you say "okay, what's the solution?"
797	And think about the future.
798	When someone makes a mistake, you say "okay, you made a mistake"
799	Next time. In the future "why don't we do it this way?"
800	Keep thinking about the future. And when you're thinking about the future your dimmer witch is on full.



801	And you're happy and you're more positive.
802	And you have more energy. You're more creative.
803	You're the best person that you can be.
804	Almost all of our problems in life come from people who are talking about the past.
805	They're worrying about the past, they're angry about the past.
806	They're ciritical about the past,
807	They keep talking about the past.
808	Don't be like that. Think about the future.
809	Now the second quality of top people is top people are goal-oriented.


##  목표를 정확히 정하고 몰두하라


810	Top people are goal-oriented in that they think about their goals most of the time.
811	They think about their goals and how to achieve them most of the time.
812	So let me give you a simple seven step formula for setting and achieving goals.
813	There are many more elaborate or bigger formulas.
814	But I'll give you a seven step formula that you can write it down on one of the back pages of your booklet.
815	Step number one is to decide exactly what you want.


##  대부분 목표가 없다

816	Most people have no idea of what they really want.
817	They say "well, I want to make more money"
818	But that's not a goal. That's just a wish or fantasy.
819	They say "I want to be healthy" but that's not a goal. These are not goals. Okay?
820	A goal is something that is very clear and measurable.
821         Number three is to set a deadline.


## 리스트를 만들어라

833	If you just do that, you have separated yourself from most of the people in the world.
834	Number four is make a list.
835	Make a list of everything that you could think of to do, to achieve the goal.
836	Every step, every activity, every action write it down.
837	Everything you can think of and as you think of new things later, write them on the list.
838	Keep writing in our list until your list is completed.
839	You can't think of anything else.


##  리스트의 순서를 정하라

840	Number five is take your list and organize the list.
841	Organize the list by priority what do you have to do first?
842	Organize the list by sequence what do you have to do before you do something else.
843	And a list organized by priority and sequence is a plan.
844	So now you ahve a goal and a plan.
845	Now you move into the top 3% of people in the world.
846	you have a goal and a plan.
847	Step number six is take action immediately on your plan.
848	Take one step, take any step.
849	But do something immediately to start the process moving.
850	Do you remember what Confucius once said "A journey of a thousand leagues (miles)begins with a sigle step"


##  매일 행동하라


851	What we all found in history is that the achievement of any great goal begins with a single step.
852	And then you take another step. And then you take another step.
853	And if you take enough steps, you could accomplish any goal in the world.
854	So number seven is do something, take action on your goal everyday.
855	Every single day once you have decided on your goal.
856	And let's say that your goal is to double your income.
857	Okay? Once you have decided to double your income.
858	Every single day do something that moves you in that direction.


##   매일 목표를 향해 나아가라

859	Never let a day go past.
860	Seven days a week, 365 days a year do something everyday that moves you toward your most important goal.
861	If you can do that, you change your life.
862	Because here's the wonderful thing.
863	When you have a clear future vision and then you break it down on paper into goals and then you do something everyday that moves you towards your goal,
864	you feel happy, you feel powerful, your self-esteem goes up, you feel confident.


##  행복하지않은건 목표가 없어서다

865	Your dimmer switch goes on full.
866	You become more optimistic and more creative.
867	Your whole world works better with a goal.
868	And the reason most people are unhappy today is because they don't have any goals
869	Just like the (the ships pilot) the aircraft pilot not having a destination.
870	He was just going in circles.




871	So I'm going to give you an exercise. "Oh. this is good stuff."
872	What I want you to do before the end of the day, before you go to bed tonight,
873	I want you to take a sheet of paper.
874	And the top of the sheet of paper, write the word "Goals"
875	And then write today's day.



876	Then I want you to write down 10 goals.
877	Write down 10 goals that you'd like to accomplish in the next year.
878	You can write more than 10, if you'd like
879	But you write at least 10.
880	This is the only real exercise I'm going to give you.
881	And if you do this, it will change your life.
882	Write down a list of 10 goals.




883	So I wnat you to promise me that before you go to bed tonight,
884	You'll make a list of 10 goals.
885	Promise me, say "yes"
886	Now even if your line says 'yes'
887	I gave this exercise to a seminar of 500 women at a convention some years ago.
888	Two months later I met a woman who attended the seminar.



889	ANd they were sharing rooms in the hotel. She was sharing a room with another woman.
890	They had come from different parts of the country.
891	And they're sharing a room to keep expenses dwon.
892	She said "oh, no." she said "I promised to write down my 10 goals"
902	She said "oh, don't waste your time."
903	She said "no, I said I'd do it, and I'm going to do it"




904	So she wrote down the 10 goals.
905	Well the unfortunate part of this story is this is the woman who didn't write down the 10 goals had left the business and gone back to working as a waitress in a cafe.
906	The woman who wrote down her 10 goals had transformed her life and doubled her income in 2 months.
907	So once you've written down your 10 goals,
908	There's one more part of the exercise.
909	I want you to look at your list of goals and I want you to ask this question.
910	Which one goal on this list if I could achieve it within 24 hours would have the biggest positive impact or effect on my life?



911	Which one goal?
912	And you read through your list of goals and you pick the one goal that if you could achieve that would have the greatest impact on your life.
913	then you take that goals and you write it at the top of a new piece of paper.
914	And then you set a deadline.
915	And then you make a list of everything you can think of to achieve that goal.
916	And then you organize the list by priority and sequence.
917	And then you take action on that goal and you do something everyday.




918	If you'll follow this formula that I've just given you.
919	Write down 10 goals, select the most important goal.
920	Make a plan to achieve that most important goal and do something everyday.
921	My promise to you is in a week, a month, a year from now.
922	Your whole life will be different. You will never be the same.
923	This changed my life. It's changed the life of every person who has ever practiced it.



924	As long as you don't make an excuse not to write down your 10 goals before you go to bed because I'm coming over to your house tonight to check.
925	Now the last orientation I want to share with you is excellence-orientation.
926	Excellence-orientation means that you must commit to excellence to be successful.
927	You must decide that whatever you do for a living you're going to be the best at what you do.
928	Now when I talk about 'Be the best' or 'Commit to excellence'.
929	I mean commit to getting into the top 10% in your business, the top 10% in terms of income.
930	Ask yourself of all the skills that I need to be successful.


##  목표 데드라인 적고 실천하라


952	What one skill will help me the most?
953	What one skill if I did it in an excellent way will help me the most to get into the top 10%?
954	What one skill if you developed and did it
955	Would help you to double your income more than any other skill?



956	And whatever that is, write it down as a goal.
957	And set a deadline to become excellent in that area.
958	And make a list of all the things that you can do to achieve the goal.
959	And then organize the list into a plan, and then take action on your plan.
960	And then do something everyday until you become excellent in that area.
961	We sell ourselves. We sell our ideas. We try to influence other people.
984	Anybody who says that "I'm not in sales" just has not understood.




985	Everyone is in sales.
986	How many people here have children?
987	Have you ever tried to make you children go to bed at night?
988	Yes. Does that require sales?
989	That requires is tremendous persuasion skills to get your children to go to bed.
990	Anyway I have four children on my own, so I know.



991	So there are 7 parts of the sales process.
992	These 7 parts largely determine everything that happens to your own life.
993	So give yourself a grade of one to ten on the 7 key result areas of selling.
994	Number one is prospecting.
995	If you're in sales and you talk to a lot of people,
996	If you try more things and you're good at prospecting.




997	You're going to be a big success.
998	Becasuse the probabilities are that you're going to make a lot of sales.
999	You're going to recruit a lot of people.
1000	You're going to have a successful business.
1001	So that's number one. Give yourself a grade of one to ten.



1002	One being the lowest. Ten being the highest.
1003	Ten means that you're absolutely excellent at prosepcting.
1004	And one means that you have a lot of work to do.
1005	Number two is establishing friendship and trust with other people.
1006	Remember people are emotional.
1007	People will only listen to you if they like you and they feel positive towrds you.
1008	And the more you like yourself, the more other people will like you.


##  상대가 원하는게 뭔지 찾아라


1009	So give yourself a scale of one to ten.
1010	You have the kind of personality where you like everybody you meet and everybody likes you.
1011	Number three is identifying their needs.
1012	By asking them questions and finding it out.
1013	WHat it is they want to accomplish with their life.
1014	What is it that they really want? What are their goals?
1015	What are their hopes and dreams with regard to what you sell?
1016	Once you're clear about what it is they need,
1017	It's much easier for you to show them your product or service.




1018	Number four is presenting.
1019	And this is where most sales are made is when you make the presentation.
1020	When you show the person that what you're offering them,
1021	You'll satisfy their needs better than anything else that they could look at.
1022	So all of good selling is to find out what people need.
1023	And show them that your product or service will help them to get it.




1024	Number five is answering questions or objections.
1025	Every prospective customer has objections.
1026	And you have to learn how to answer those objections.
1027	So give yourself a scale of one to ten
1028	At a ten, you're very good at answering questions.
1029	With a one, you're not very good at all.
1030	Number six is closing the sale or getting people to take action




1031	Many people think that all they do is 
1032	Have a conversation with another person about the business.
1033	That's the same as selling.
1034	No! you're only selling,
1035	When you can get the other person to make a commitment to take action.
1036	Remember that commitment to action is the end of all your activities.




1037	That is your goal is get other people to take action.
1038	And finally number seven is to give that person good service and good support
1039	So they not only buy more of your product
1040	But they recommend other people to the business.
1041	They recommend other people to your product or service.
1042	So write a scale of one to ten, give yourself a grade and ask yourself.
1043	##"What is your weakest skill?"
1044	Because this is what we learned is your weakest key skill sets the height of your income.


##  중요 스킬을 찾아라


1045	Your weakest key skill in your business determines how much you earn.
1046	Let me ask you a quick question.
1047	If a group of children are going for a walk
1048	Which child sets the speed of the entire group of children?
1049	Well, the answer is it's always the slowest child.
1050	Their whole group has to slow down for the slowest child.
1051	In your career, your weakest skill is your slowest child.
1052	Your weakest skill sets the speed at which you achieve all your other goals.




1053	So what you do is you say the one skill that will help me the most is my weakest skill.
1054	Because I bring that skill up,
1055	It'll help me to speed up toward my goal more than anything else.
1056	Now, if you start off and you identify your weakest skill,
1057	And you work on it for a week, for a month, for a year,
1058	Eventually you'll master that skill.
1059	Then what do you do? What is your next step?
1060	But, your enxt step is you now say "What is my weakest skill?"
1061	And you go to work on that skill.
1062	And for the rest of your career,




1063	You dedicate yourself to improving in one key area at a time.
1064	And it's always the one area that will help you more than any other area.
1065	For the rest of your life, you keep bringing up your weakest skill.
1066	And that will move you adead faster in your life than any other strategy that you can use.
1067	In our society, success only comes from being excellent at doing the most important parts of your job.
1068	And you could be one skill away from doubling your income.
1069	The final orientation is action-orientation.
1070	As I said it at the beginning


##  많이 행동하면 많이 얻는다

1071	And I said it in the middle and I now said it at the end.
1072	The most important orientation of all is action-orientation.
1073	You see the more action you take, the more energy you have.
1074	The more action you take, the more experience you get.
1075	The more experience you get, the more you learn.
1076	The more you learn, the better you get.
1077	The better you get, the better results you get from every action.
1078	So soon you get onto an upward expiry in your life.
1079	You try more things, you persist longer, you keep going, you never give up,
1080	you keep working toward goals and your life starts going faster and faster and faster.
1081	Let me just finish up by saying this.


##  많은 실행을 하라

1082	Right at the beginning I said that South Korea is now entering into the greatest time in all of human history.
1083	There are more opportunities and possibilities for you now and tomorrow and next year than have ever existed in all of history.
