I useed to be a shepherd in the Lub region of France.
 It was a very isolated place,, so I was often all alone in the pasture.
Sometimes, I did not see many people for weeks.
During those weeks, I only had my dog and the flocks of sheep to ccompany
me.

 From time to time, I saw a loner who lived on Mount llure.
 He would come down to hear some news of the outside wourld.
 Also, I sometimes saw coal miners.
 They worked in the coal mines near my field, so I spoke with them 
as they ewnt back and forth to the coal mines.

 Once every two weeks, I got a visitor from the farm.
This person was usually the farm boy or an old woman who worked at the farm.
 They were sent to bring me supplies on a mule. I was always happy to see them.
They would tell me all of the news from the lowlands.

 However, the news that interested me the most was about my master"s daughter.
Her name was Stephanette, and she was the most beautiful girl in the surrounding area.
Without seeming to take too much insterest, I would ask how Stephanette was doing.
I asked if there were any young men who wanted to marry her.

 Of course, I was just a lowly shepherd who worked for her father. I had to remind 
myself  that there was no way that Stephanette would be 
interested in me. After all, there were many wealthy and handsome young men in the area.
 One Sunday, I was waiting for the delivery boy to arrive. It had been two weeks since my 
last delivery, so I was running out of supplies. By ten o'clock, no one had arrived yet.

오후 5:39 2023-09-18

 "That's odd,"I thought. "There must be a problem at my master's house."
 I continued to wait, but no one came by noon.  "They must have forgotten to
send my supplies," I said to myself.
 Around noon, I noticed that a big storm was coming.
In the distance, some dark clouds were gathering. Soon, heavy rain began to 
pour down. "Now I understand," I said to myself.

오후 5:40 2023-09-19

 "The bad weather has delayed the delivery person. The roads must be muddy by now.                              
 I should not expect him to arrive yet.
 A few hours later, the storm was over. The sun shone high in the sky, and its warm rays
spread bright light all over the fields.

 All of a sudden, I heard the familiar sound of the mule's bells. I eagerly looked to see 
if it was the farmhand or the old woman. However, it was neither the famhand nor
the old woman. It was the beautiful Stephanette! Oh, what a wonderful surprise that 
was!  She got off the mule, and then she said to me, "I got lost on my way up the hill.

오후 9:35 2023-09-21

 "Are you all right, mistree?" I asked.
 She smiled and nodded at me.
 "The famhand is sick," said Stephanette," and the old woman is visiting her chidren 
to spend the holiday with them. so
 my father sent me instead."
 I could not take my eyes off her. She looked so beautiful in that fresh afternoon air.

 In fact, I had never seen her so close before. And I had never spoken to her.
I had only ever seen her from a distance.
 When I returned to the lowlands in the winter, her father would invite me to dinner 
at his farm. At those times, she would walk silently across the room and not say a word 
to any of the servants.

오전 12:08 2023-09-23

 She had always looked very proud during those times. And now she was standing 
in front of me.
 After she took my supplies off the mule, Stephanette looked around the area. She
seemed curious about the pasture and the small barn.


오전 9:13 2023-09-23

"So this is where is you live,shepherd?" she asked. She noticed my bed in the barn. It
was a simple bed made of straw and sheepskin. There were a cape and a stick hanging
on the wall above my bed.
 "You must be lonely and bored because you are always alone." she continued. "What do
you do all day long?"
I wanted to answer, "I only think about you, Stephanette, "but I did not.

오전 9:27 2023-09-24

 As a matter of fact, I could not say a single word to her. How embarrassed I was.
 Stephanette must have noticed my emvarrassment.
She started to tease me.
 "Do the fairies come to see you sometimes?" She was aughing with a twinkle in her eyes.
 I thought she was like a fairy, but I did not say those words. Instead I said nothing.

오전 8:20 2023-09-25

 "Well, I must leave now," she said. Stephanette got back on the mule and said goodbye 
to me. Then, the mule led her back toward the farm. I watched her as she disappeared 
down the hill. The sound of the mule's footsteps continued for a while. The sound of 
those footsteps remained with me for a long time.

 Later in the evening, I brought the flock of sheep back in from the fields. As I was completing 
my chores, I heard a voice calling my name. It was Stephanette. She had returned. But she was
not smiliing anymore. Now, she was soaking wet and shiverring from the cold.

오전 7:50 2023-09-27

 "At the bottom of the mountain, there is a river as you know. The rain from the storm 
caused the river to flood. The water has risen very high. I tried to cross the river, 
but I almost drowned in the water. I was so scared and didn't know what to do. So
I just returned here." she said  in a trembling voice.

오전 8:48 2023-09-28

 I was not sure what to do. It was not right for her to spend the night on the mountain. I also
could not leave the flock of sheep to take her home. But then I thought,
"The nights in july are short. It's only one night."
 I immediately made a fire so that she could dry he feet and clothes.

오전 8:57 2023-09-29

 Then, I gave her some milk and cheese, but Stephanette was not interested in eating.
She burst into tears. And I almost felt like crying, too. It was completely dark outside. I
took her to the barn, and I prepared a bed for her. I laid out a new sheepskin on the
fresh straw so that she could rest. I said goodnight and  went outside.

오전 9:10 2023-09-30

I sat down in front of the door. I rtied not to think of the young lady who was resting 
in my house. But all that I could think of was her. I was proud because I had assisted her.
 Tonight, it was my responsivility to keep her safe.
